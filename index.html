                <p class="journal-body">After we went to UP, they discussed many things with us, and their facilitators were knowledgeable. However, I noticed that there is still a need for improvement, particularly in their facilities. 
                                        Overall, it was a great experience, and I learned a lot Especially in guiding us for our upcoming capstone project, they taught us what needs to be done and shared good ideas and best practices.</p>

                <p class="journal-date">November 13, 2025</p>
                <p class="journal-body">On Day 2 of our educational tour, we visited DYNATA Philippines Inc., where we were warmly welcomed as visitors. As we entered the company, I observed that the environment was quiet, well organized, and visually impressive.
                Regarding their facilitators, there was one speaker whom we did not fully understand; however, it was still a good experience because we were able to learn about the company’s policies and witness how organized their employees are. Overall, it was a great experience, especially with the female facilitator. There were two facilitators a male and a female and she explained to us the possible career opportunities we may have in the near future related to our course.
                After that, we proceeded to our second company visit, RIVANT IT Cebu. We experienced a facilitator who sparked greater interest in our course because of the way he taught us. He made us realize the reality that the world we are entering is not easy. I also observed the cleanliness of their company and how everything was well-organized.
                Overall, I learned a lot from the facilitator because he clearly emphasized that life is not easy. He made us realize that the path we have chosen is not simple to achieve without hard work and dedication. Overall, it was a great and meaningful learning experience with this company.

                <p class="journal-body">On Day 3, we visited MATA Technologies. I observed that the company is relatively small; however, it is well-organized, especially their system. Through their website and VR technology, users can virtually tour different places around Cebu, allowing them to explore locations without physically being there. Overall, it was a great and enjoyable experience with this company.
                After that, we went to the departure area and traveled to Bohol City, where we experienced and enjoyed its beauty.

                <p class="journal-date">November 15, 2025</p>
                <p class="journal-body">On the last day of our tour, we visited T.A.R.S.I.E.R. 117, which stands for Telephone and Radio System Integrated Emergency Response, in Bohol City. During our travel, I initially thought that we were going to see tarsiers; however, it turned out to be an organization similar to a 911 emergency response team.
                Upon our arrival, I observed how welcoming the place was. It was clear that they had well prepared the area for our visit, as everything was clean and well-organized. Most especially, the facilitator who handled our group helped me learn a lot about Bohol City. Overall, it was a meaningful and educational experience.
                Overall, it was a great experience, especially with the facilitators. They taught us and showed us their facilities, where I observed that they have their own broadcast monitors and CCTV cameras covering the entire Bohol City.</p>
                <p class="journal-body">After that, we experienced the Loboc River Floating Restaurant in Bohol. While we were having our lunch, we were entertained by performers who sang for us. As the boat cruised along the river, we saw both young and elderly locals showcasing their cultural dances.
                Afterward, we visited the Tarsier Sanctuary, followed by a trip to Bohollywood. We then went to some of the most popular tourist destinations in Bohol, including the Chocolate Hills and the Bilar Man-Made Forest. In these places, I experienced the beauty and cleanliness of the surroundings.
                Overall, our educational tour was a great and worthwhile experience, and I truly felt that every moment was meaningful and fulfilling</p>
